input: a given list
output: boolen value stands for whether subsequence of length 3 exists or not

1. we need two pointers:
    first = second = float('inf') (infinite large)
2. then we loop around the list, if there is a third element which larger then the second non infinite 
   element, return True/else False
   
******* if/elif ********
if: it will excute all the if statements/else no matter whether the previous if statement
elif: don't excute the later elif/else if the previous if statement is True
