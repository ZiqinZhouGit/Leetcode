input: a string
output: longest substring without repeating characters

1. we use pointers at this time:
    start = 0
    end = 0
    max_length = 0
2. while end < len(s):
      temp_length = end - start + 1
      max_length = max(temp_length, max_length)
      if there is a repeated character in the temp_substring:
          start += 1
3. return max_length
