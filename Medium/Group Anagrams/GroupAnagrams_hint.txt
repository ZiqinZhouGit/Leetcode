input: list contains all the strings
       ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
output: put all the anagrams in one list, then put them into the list
        [
          ["ate","eat","tea"],
          ["nat","tan"],
          ["bat"]
          ]

1. we define a function:
      transfer our string into an ascending order string
      (so if two strings are anagrams, after the transfer function, they share the same result)
2. we build a dictionary:
      we use the transfered string as the key, value is the list of all the anagrams
   if the transfer of the item is already one of the keys:
        value.append(item)
   else:
        new key is built
3.build a result = []:
      loop around the whole dictionary and append all the values
